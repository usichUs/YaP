# Task: Tile Calculation for Room Repair

# Step 1: Create variables for length and width and assign values
length = 8
width = 10

# Step 2: Calculate the area of the room using the original dimensions
initial_tiles_needed = length * width
print(f"Initial tiles needed: {initial_tiles_needed}")

# Step 3: Update the length to 20 as there was an error
length = 20
updated_tiles_needed = length * width
print(f"Updated tiles needed: {updated_tiles_needed}")

# Independent task: Calculate the area of a rectangle with sides 23 and 13
rectangle_length = 23
rectangle_width = 13
rectangle_area = rectangle_length * rectangle_width
print(f"Area of the rectangle: {rectangle_area}")
